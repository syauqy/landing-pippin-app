## Welcome to Pippin

Pippin is a minimalist journal app for overthinkers. When your thoughts feel loud, Pippin gives you a safe, private space to write it out, step away, and come back lighter.

**How it works:**

1. **Vent your thoughts** – Type or speak to brain dump your worries, ideas, or feelings—no judgment, just relief.
2. **Lock it away** – Your entry is locked for 24 hours, giving your mind a break while your thought "grows" in your garden.
3. **Watch it bloom** – After 24 hours, your thought blooms into a flower—see your progress visually and celebrate growth.
4. **Gentle insights** – Receive supportive reflections from Pippin—never judgment, just perspective.
