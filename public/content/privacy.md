# Privacy Policy for Overthinking Journal

**Last Updated:** November 30, 2025

Thank you for using Overthinking Journal ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have in relation to it.

### 1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the app, as well as information that is collected automatically.

#### Personal Information You Disclose to Us:

**Account Information:** When you choose to create an account by linking your Google or Apple account, we receive your name, email address, and profile picture as provided by those services.

**Journal Entries:** We collect and store the journal entries ("dumps") you create in the app, including your thoughts, worries, and reflections that you choose to record. This content is stored securely and privately.

**Onboarding Preferences:** We collect your worry type preference and preferred language for speech recognition to personalize your experience.

#### Information Automatically Collected:

**Anonymous User ID:** When you first use the app, we assign you a unique, anonymous identifier through Firebase Authentication to store your initial data locally. This ID is not linked to your personal identity until you choose to create a permanent account.

**Usage Data:** We may collect information about how you interact with our app for the purpose of improving our services.

#### Purchase Information:

All in-app purchases are processed through Apple's App Store or Google Play Store. We do not collect or store your payment card details.

### 2. HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide, operate, and maintain the core functionality of the Overthinking Journal app.
- Sync your journal entries and preferences across devices if you create an account.
- Enable voice-to-text journaling using your preferred language.
- Send you optional reminders if you enable the notification feature.
- Improve the app's performance and user experience.

### 3. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties. Your journal entries are private and only accessible to you. Your data is stored securely in Google's Firebase platform. We may use analytics services (like PostHog) to improve the app, but these services do not have access to your journal content.

### 4. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

We use Google Firebase, a secure and industry-standard platform, to store and protect your data. While we take all reasonable measures to protect your information, no electronic transmission or storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

### 5. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time. You can delete your account from the Settings page within the app, which will permanently delete all associated data from our servers.
