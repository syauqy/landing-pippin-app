# Privacy Policy for Pippin - Overthinking Journal

**Last Updated:** December 17, 2025

## 1. Introduction

Thank you for choosing Pippin ("App," "we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. When you use our App, you trust us with your personal data. We take that trust very seriously.

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, store, and share your information when you use our mobile application and related services.

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 2. Information We Collect

We collect information that helps us provide the App's core features (journaling, garden visualization, and AI insights).

### A. Information You Provide to Us

- Account Data: When you register, we collect authentication tokens and a User ID provided by your chosen login provider (Apple Sign-In or Google Sign-In). We may collect your name/email if provided by these services, solely for account management.
- User Content (Journal Entries): We collect the text, sentiment selections, and voice-to-text transcripts you input into the App ("Thoughts" or "Dumps"). This data is essential for the "Garden" visualization and "Pippin's Letters" features.
- Customer Support: If you contact us for support, we may collect your email address and the content of your message.

### B. Automatically Collected Information

- Usage Data: We collect anonymous data about how you use the App, such as which features you visit, session duration, and the "seeds" you plant. This helps us improve the App experience.
- Device Information: We may collect basic device details (e.g., iOS version, device model, language settings) to ensure compatibility and troubleshoot bugs.
- Transaction Data: If you purchase a subscription, our payment processor (Apple App Store) handles the financial data. We do not store your credit card information. We only receive a receipt token (via RevenueCat) to verify your "Pro" status.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use your data for the following legitimate business purposes:

- To Provide the Service: To create your account, store your journal history, render your "Garden," and sync your progress across your devices.
- To Generate AI Insights: We process your journal text inputs to generate "Sentiment Analysis" and "Pippin's Letters" (AI-generated responses).
- To Maintain Security: To protect your account and prevent fraud.
- To Communicate: To send you important updates regarding your account or changes to our policies.

## 4. How We Process Data with AI

To provide the "Pippin" persona and sentiment analysis, your text inputs (Journal Entries) are sent to third-party Artificial Intelligence providers (e.g., Google Gemini) via secure, encrypted APIs.

- No Training on Your Data: We configure our third-party API usage to ensure that your personal journal entries are not used to train their general public models.
- Transient Processing: Data sent to AI providers is for the sole purpose of generating a response and is processed in accordance with their strict enterprise privacy standards.

## 5. Sharing Your Information

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.

We only share data with trusted third-party service providers who assist us in operating the App:

- Google Firebase: For secure cloud database storage, authentication, and analytics.
- RevenueCat: For managing subscription status and purchase validation.
- Google Gemini (or similar AI providers): For processing text to generate in-app content.

These parties are contractually obligated to keep your information confidential and use it only for the purposes we specify.

## 6. Data Retention and Security

- Security: We use industry-standard encryption (SSL/TLS) to protect your data during transmission. Your journal entries are stored in secure, access-controlled cloud databases (Firestore).
- Retention: We retain your personal data and journal entries only for as long as your account is active.
- Deletion: If you delete your account via the App settings, all your personal data, journal history, and garden progress are permanently deleted from our servers immediately.

## 7. Your Privacy Rights

Depending on your location, you have certain rights regarding your data:

- Access: You can view your journal history directly within the App.
- Correction: You can update your account settings within the App.
- Deletion: You have the right to request the deletion of your account and all associated data. You can perform this action instantly via the "Delete Account" button in the App's settings menu.

## 8. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
