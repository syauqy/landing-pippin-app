**Last Updated:** December 17, 2025

## 1. Introduction and Agreement

Welcome to Pippin ("we," "our," or "us"). By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the Pippin mobile application (the "App") and its related services (collectively, the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the Service.

## 2. Medical Disclaimer

PIPPIN IS NOT A MEDICAL DEVICE AND DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE.

(a) No Professional Advice: The App, including the "Pippin" AI persona, "Garden" visualizations, and sentiment analysis, is designed for self-help, journaling, and entertainment purposes only. It is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition, including anxiety, depression, or other mental health disorders.

(b) Not a Replacement for Therapy: The Service is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read on the App.

(c) Emergency Situations: If you are experiencing a medical emergency, are thinking about suicide, or may be a danger to yourself or others, immediately call emergency services (e.g., 911 or your local emergency number) or go to the nearest emergency room. The App is not monitored for emergency situations and cannot respond to crisis alerts.

## 3. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Services

The Service utilizes Artificial Intelligence ("AI") technologies (provided by third-party vendors such as Google Gemini) to generate responses, letters, and insights.

(a) Accuracy: AI generation is probabilistic and may occasionally produce incorrect, repetitive, nonsensical, or "hallucinated" responses. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any AI-generated content.

(b) User Discretion: You acknowledge that the "Pippin" character is an automated system. You should evaluate the accuracy of any output and should not rely on it as factual or professional advice.

(c) Input Data: By using the feature, you grant us permission to process your text inputs through our third-party AI providers for the sole purpose of generating the Service's content.

## 4. Eligibility and Accounts

(a) Age Requirement: You must be at least 13 years of age (or the minimum age of digital consent in your country) to use the App. If you are under 18, you represent that you have your parent or guardian’s permission to use the Service.

(b) Account Security: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials (via Apple Sign-In or Google Sign-In). You are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.

## 5. Subscription and Payments

The App offers "Pro" features which require a paid subscription (Monthly or Annual).

(a) Billing: All payments are processed and managed by the Apple App Store (iOS). We do not directly store your credit card information.

(b) Automatic Renewal: Your subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your Apple ID account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the then-current price.

(c) Cancellations: You may manage or cancel your subscription at any time by going to your Apple ID Account Settings after purchase. Deleting the App does not cancel your subscription.

(d) Refunds: All refund requests must be directed to Apple Support. We do not have the ability to process refunds for Apple App Store transactions directly.

(e) Free Trials: If you sign up for a free trial, you will be automatically charged the applicable subscription fee at the end of the trial period unless you cancel before the trial expires.

## 6. User Content and Conduct

(b) License to Us: By submitting User Content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, transfer, display, and process your User Content solely for the purpose of providing and improving the Service to you (e.g., to generate your Garden and Letters). We will not sell your User Content to third parties for advertising purposes.
